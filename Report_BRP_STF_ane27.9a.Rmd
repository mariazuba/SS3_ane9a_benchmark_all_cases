# Biological Reference points

The methodology applied was the same decided in WKPELA 2018 (page 286 of WKPELA 2018 report (ICES, 2018)) following ICES guidelines for calculation of reference points for category 1 and 2 stocks and the report of the workshop to review the ICES advisory framework for short lived species ICES WKMSYREF5 2017 (ICES, 2017).

According to the above ICES guidelines and the $S-R$ plot characteristics (Figure \ref{fig:stock-recluta}), this stock component can be classified as a “stock type 5” (i.e. stocks showing no evidence of impaired recruitment or with no clear relation between stock and recruitment (no apparent $S-R$ signal)).

```

The estimation of $B_{lim}$ was carried out assuming $B_{lim} = B_{loss}$. For the 9a South anchovy, $B_{loss}$ was calculated based on the estimated SSB in 2010, with a value of 6552.06 t, representing 0.39% of the unfished biomass ($B_0 = 16865$ t). This value falls below the range suggested by WKREF1 and WKREF2 (ICES, 2022), which recommend setting $B_{lim}$ between 10% and 25% of $B_0$, depending on the species' life-history characteristics.

Three alternative methods were evaluated to calculate $B_{lim}$: a) $B_{lim} = 0.2 \times B_0$, b) $B_{lim} = B_{loss}$, and c) $B_{lim} = B_{pa} \times e^{-1.645 \times \sigma_B}$, where $B_{pa} = B_{loss}$ and $\sigma_B$ is the standard deviation of $ln(SSB)$ in the terminal year of the assessment, accounting for uncertainty in the SSB. If $\sigma_B$ is unknown, ICES guidelines recommend using a default value of $\sigma = 0.20$, or $\sigma = 0.30$ for small pelagic species.

The results of these alternatives are presented in Table  \ref{tb:stf0} and Figure  \ref{fig:biological_reference}. Using $\sigma = 0.2$ provides an intermediate solution between the assessment's estimated value and the recommended value for small pelagic species, ensuring that $B_{lim}$ is calculated in accordance with the stock's biological characteristics and ICES guidelines. Therefore, the recommended value is $B_{lim} = B_{pa} \times e^{-1.645 \times \sigma_B} = 4715$ tonnes, with $B_{pa} = B_{loss}$ and $\sigma_B = 0.2$, as applied in other fisheries.

# Short-term predictions

The SS3 forecast module was used to perform short-term projections, considering the model's final year conditions, associated uncertainties, and varying fishing intensities. The initial stock size was derived from the abundance at ages 0-3 on January 1 of the final assessment year, while the spawning stock biomass (SSB) was estimated for April 1. Natural mortality and maturity rates were held constant, with selectivity and weight-at-age averaged over the last three years. Recruitment for the forecast year was projected using the Stock Synthesis Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship and the geometric mean of the last three years recruitment.

Status quo fishing mortality (Fsq) was calculated as the average across the last three years, by fleet and season (FfleetQ1=0.29, FfleetQ2=1.65, FfleetQ3=2.93, FfleetQ4=1.7). The Figures  \ref{fig:stf1} and \ref{fig:stf2} show the short-term predictions of catch and SSB evaluated at different fishing
mortality levels, under the recruitment projection scenario based the stock-recruitment relationship used in the model to forecast (Table  \ref{tb:stf1}) and the geometric mean of the last three years recruitment (Table \ref{tb:stf3}). 

Multipliers of the status quo fishing mortality (Fsq*Mult) of 0, 1, 1.2, 1.6, and 2,0 were evaluated. Additionally, an iterative process was used to identify the multiplier that would achieve a 2024 and 2025 catch with probabilities of 5% and 50% that SSB in 2024 and 2025 would fall below $Blim$ ($p(SSB < Blim)$ = 0.05 and 0.5, respectively).  These multipliers were adjusted according to the projected recruitment scenarios, providing management options based on different levels of fishing mortality.  Tables \ref{tb:stf2} y \ref{tb:stf4} presents the management options derived from the short-term forecasts, evaluated at different fishing mortality levels, corresponding to the catch scenarios described previously.
